				<li>Confidentiality -	prevents the unauthorized disclosure of data </li>
				<li>Encryption - scrambles data to make it unreadable by unauthorized personnel </li>
				<li>Identification -	Users claim identity with unique username</li>
				<li>Authentication - prove identity with password or something else</li>
				<li>Authorization - grant or restrict access to resources after authentication</li>
				<li>Availability - Data and services are available when needed</li>
				<li>Steganography - hiding data within data</li>
				<li>Integrity - ensures the data hasn't been modified/tampered with - 2 key concepts</li>
				<ul>
				<li>Provides assurance that data has not been modified, tampered with, or corrupted</li>
				<li>Hashing verifies ingrity</li></ul>
				<li>Hashing - used to enforce integrity. As long as two documents are the same the hash will not change</li>
				<li>Hash - a number created by executing a hashing algorithm against data </li>
				<li>Redundancy - Goal to provide fault tolerance and to remove a single point of failure</li>
				<li>Patching - updates to software to stop known exploits and correct bugs</li>
				<li>Layered Security/Defense in Depth -	security practice of implementing several layers of protection</li>
				<li>Controls -	how someone controls risk</li>
				<li>Risk - likelihood a threat will exploit a vulnerability resulting in a loss</li>
				<li>Risk mitigation - uses controls to reduce risk</li>
				<li>Security incident - adverse event or series of events that can negatively affect the CIA of an organizations IT systems and data</li>
				<li>Technical controls - use technology to reduce vulnerabilities</li>
				<li>Management controls - use planning and methods to reduce and manage risk</li>
				<li>Risk assessments - help quantify and qualify risk in an org so the org can focus only on serious risks</li>
				<li>Vulnerability assessments - attempts to disvoer current vulnerabilities/weaknesses</li>
				<li>Penetration tests - go beyond vulnerability assessment by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities</li>
				<li>Operational controls - Help ensure that day-to-day operations of an organization comply with overall security plan</li>
				<li>Secuirty audit - determine the security posture of an organization</li>
                <li>Active IDS (intrusion detection system) - an IDS that can also modify the enviroment to block the attack from continuing</li>
                <li>Deterent controls - attempt ot discourage a threat</li>
                <li>Compensation controls - alternative controls used instead of a primary control</li>
                <li>Cipher locks - pattern based door locking mechanism. Can be electronic or manual</li>
                <li>Proximity cards - RFID cards that unlock a door when they trigger a sensor</li>
                <li>Tailgating - someone follows closely behind someone else to get through physical security; prevented with mantraps</li>
                <li>Mantraps - mechanism designed to control access to a securie area through a buffer zone - only allows one person through at a time</li>
                <li>Bollards - waist high steel and concrete posts that prevent cars from driving through a wall to break into a building</li>
                <li>False positive - an alert/alarm triggered when an event is non-threatening</li>
                <li>False negative - a threatening event that does not trigger an alert/alarm</li>
                <li>Honeypot - a "sweet" looking server that is left open and encourages an attacker to attack with relative ease. Tricks them into thinking they have accessed data but nothing is compromised. Also helpful to learn how an attacker works</li>
                <li>Honeynet - basically a honeypot but an entire network</li>
                <li>File-level encryption - encryption of a file or folder, most OS have built in tools to acomplish</li>
                <li>Data exfiltration - the unauthorized transfer of data outside an organization</li>
                <li>DLP (Data Loss Prevention) - examine and inspect data looking for unauthorized data transmissions</li>
                <li>SAN (Storage Area Network) - provides connectivity for high-speed data storage devices in specialized high-speed network</li>
                <li>SaS (Software as a Service) - application/software provided for users over the internet or other network</li>
                <li>Threat Vector - the method used to activate a threat and cna originate from three primary sources (external, internal, and the supply chain)</li>
                <li>Malicious insider - anyone who has legitimate access to an organizations internal resources but exploits this access for personal gain or damage agains the organization</li>

                <li>Quantatative risk assessment - measures the risk using specific monetary ammount</li>
                <li>Qualitative measurements - use judgements to determine what is acceptable risk</li>
                <li>Vulnerability Assessment - identify vulnerabilities, or weaknesses, within systems, networks, and organizations, part of overall risk management plan</li>
                <li>Passive testing of security controls - does not attempt to exploit any vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>User review - review permissions of users</li>
                <li>Five Nines - 99.999% uptime. Equates to less than 6 minutes of downtime a year</li>
